Sample Xcode project to demonstrate pushing a view controller into current navigation controller when user open the app by tapping push notification. This example works when the app is in background and user tap on the push notification.

## Instruction

Make sure you have set the signing certificate in project settings before building this app into your iOS device :

This project uses [MessageKit pod](https://github.com/MessageKit/MessageKit) for the messaging UI, open the **.xcworkspace** instead of .xcodeproj.

  

I have made a macOS app to send push notification easily, feel free to [check it out on the Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pushever-apns-tester/id1455738387?ls=1&mt=12) .
